# Fit Bit Wellness Project 
This is a repository of the key visualizations and tech tools I used in FitBit Wellness Project. In addition, the key data insights that I gleaned from analyzing the smart consumer watch data to track patterns. Here's more detail about the business purpose of this project. 

**Project Summary** 

Urksa Srsen believes that analyzing Bellabeat app consumer usage can help the company unlock new insights that can guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy to grow the company and assist in becoming a larger player in the global market. The goal of this project is to analyze smart device usage data to gain insight into how consumers are using the smart device and then use these insights to come up with recommendations to help guide the marketing strategy for the company.
